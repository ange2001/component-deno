### Development

Runs `deno task dev` when deployment is started, which executes your app in watch mode with network and environment variable access:
```sh
deno run --watch --allow-net --allow-env src/main.ts
```
No `deno install` is required, as new import in TypeScript files will trigger Deno to automatically download and cache those modules as needed.

### Production

Builds a production-ready image. Runs `deno task prod` to start your app with network and environment variable access:
```sh
deno run --allow-net --allow-env src/main.ts
```
Dependencies are cached during the build stage using `deno cache .`.
